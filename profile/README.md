## Geospatial Research Lab
Located on the lower level of Bender Library, American University Library's Geospatial Research Lab supports the research and teaching programs of American University faculty, staff, and students, through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and resources. The lab builds and curates American University's spatial data collection and provides support for both research methods and software in the pursuit of robust geospatial research on campus. AU scholars are encouraged to explore how geographic visualization and analysis can assist in examining relationship and causalities, uncovering patterns, and making predictions.
